#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) exponentially


b)O(n log n)


c)O(n)

## Exercise II
O(n)

n-story building = height of the building which is going to be input. 
e = number of eggs
f = the floor number that the egg will break
x = floor number
if floor number >= f then egg cracks
else floor number < f then egg doesn't crack

mid = n-story building // 2

def egg_drop:
    top = n-story building
    bottom = 0 
    mid = n-story building // 2

    while the top is greater than or equal to the bottom
    if mid == egg cracks:
        top = mid -1
    elif mid == egg not cracking:
        bottom = mid + 1
    else:
        return bottom



determine what f is
