#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) the time that it will take to run this function will be in direct proportion of the size of input.  


b)O(log n) the code is using one while loop. As the size of the input increases it will increase at a slow rate since only one loop is present. 
 


c)O(n) the code is performing one recursive function. As the input increases it will always grow at the same rate.


## Exercise II
O(n)

n-story building = height of the building which is going to be input. 
e = number of eggs
f = the floor number that the egg will break
x = floor number
if floor number >= f then egg cracks
else floor number < f then egg doesn't crack

mid = n-story building // 2

def egg_drop:
    top = n-story building
    bottom = 0 
    mid = n-story building // 2

    while the top is greater than or equal to the bottom
    if mid == egg cracks:
        top = mid -1
    elif mid == egg not cracking:
        bottom = mid + 1
    else:
        return bottom



determine what f is
